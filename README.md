## Abstract 
`(for Decisions Makers)`

## Purpose and Goals to be achieved by this project

Goal of this Exploration project is to **understand** 

a) how the Theme is **setup** in general in terms of templates, archetypes, etc.

b) its **components** like for instancen the Disquos component

c) how this theme **integrates wie existing content files** (can we put on top, or do we have to copy/past content into the themes folder)
d) **hosting**: How to push this Example project on a Hosting Environment (Netlify, AWS)

### Out of Scope

## Issues
The following Issues have been found: 

### Hyperlinks
#### Problem
Hyperlink in the text such as [myfile](../myfile.md) do not work, because the Hugo compiler does not resolve them. This is a general issue that is not specific to the Theme but neither solved by it. #### Solution
Pragmatically we can write the URL link as [myfile](../myfile/). 
This solution works in the Website but breaks the MonsterGen experience for navigating in Markdown Docs. 



## Roadmap
See the open issues for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
